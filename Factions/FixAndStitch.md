# Fix and Stitch

Doc and Sprok is the operation of [Tweak](../Characters/Tweak.md) and [Twerk](../Characters/Twerk.md), who have gone into the business of mechanical and medical repair, specializing in Vault Hunter clientele who often need both at once. As a matter of saftey, they operate out of a well-hidden ship, whose location is only available to those who prepay for services, and only by appointment so as not to let multiple teams meet.

## Aspects
* *Never tell one Vault Hunter another's business*
* *Never in the same place twice*
