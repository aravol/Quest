# Fix and Stitch

Doc and Sprok is the business name of [Tweak](../Characters/Tweak.md) and [Twerk](../Characters/Twerk.md), who have gone into the business of mechanical and medical repair, specializing in Vault Hunter clientele. As a matter of saftey, they operate out of a well-hidden ship, whose location is only available to those who prepay for services.
