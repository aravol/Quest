# Natives, the original inhabitants of Europa
The Natives are the original inhabitants of Europa, split off from the [Cthonians](../Cthonians) after a bloody civil war.

Racially, the Natives consist of several species who made peace long before contact from Earth, the most prominent of which are as follows;
* [Tritons](../../Races/Tritons)
