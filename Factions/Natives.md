# Natives, the original inhabitants of Europa
The Natives are the original inhabitants of Europa, split off from the [Cthonians](Cthonians.md) after a bloody civil war.

Racially, the Natives consist of several species who made peace long before contact from Earth, the most prominent of which are as follows;
* [Tritons](../Races/Tritons.md)
* [Sahuaguin](../Races/Sahuaguin.md)

The Natives seek the Vaults in the hopes to save their culture from extinction at the hands of the Cthonians.
