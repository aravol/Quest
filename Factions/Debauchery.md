# Debauchery Duo, famed thieves
The Debauchery Duo was [Virgo](../../Characters/Virgo) and [Aquarius](../../Characters/Aquarius), who have since joined the crew of the [*Silence*](../Silence). Despite their name, or perhaps as a tactic against their less witting victims, they were more likely to snatch their marks in the dead of night than engage in carousing or grifting.
