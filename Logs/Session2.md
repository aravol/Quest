# Session 2, of Murder

With [Barry](../_site/Characters/BarryMccockiner.md) severely injured, the crew of the [Silence](../_site/Factions/Silence.md) are in need of medical and mechanical assistance. Thinking himself securing a deal, [Mr. Garfunkle](../_site/Characters/ArtGarfunckle.md) gets the crew an appointment with [Fix and Stitch](../Factions/FixAndStitch.md) at a discount for some undisclosed "favor" on arrival...

## Fix and Stitch
While [Odysseus](../_site/Characters/Odysseus.md) brings [Barry](../_site/Characters/BarryMccockiner.md) on board, the latter teleports off and makes a mess of the pharmesutical lab before being sedated and treated for his severe concussion. Despite the inappropriate sedative, his treatment won't take more than a day and some stitches.

However, the favor that [Twerk](../_site/Characters/Twerk.md) requested, is to solve a murder; specifically, her last 3 patients have been murdered by medical means in the middle of the night, and all in the previous week. Thinking that cooperating will keep their own teammate alive, [Virgo](../_site/Characters/Virgo.md) and [Aquarius](../_site/Characters/Aquarius.md) join in.

## The Stakeout
While Odysseus is dragged away by [Tweak](../_site/Characters/Tweak.md), who's interested not just in repairing Barry's suit but also in "examining" Odysseus's bionic parts, Virgo and Aquarius stake out the medical bay, keeping an eye out from the shadows.

They don't have to wait long, though, as the assailant, armed in one of Tweak's spare Spartan Suits, shows up to ambush Virgo with an oxygen tank. Faking a drop long enough for Aquarius to jump on her back, the two attempt an age old team con of theirs, only to learn that their assailant is more than strong enough to throw Aquarius down the hallway. Acting fast, Virgo is still able to strike back at her assailant with another tank, forcing the offender to flee.

During this escape, the offender runs headlong into Odysseus, but is able to jump out the garage bay's port. Odyssues manages to throw his spear and split her helmet, revealing the long, green hair of a Triton before she escapes.

## The Shakedown
Seeking answers, Odysseus questions Tweak about which suit the attacker was using, only for Tweak herself to discover the missing suit among her personal projects, calling it "Gamma." Tweak also reveals that the suit is equipped with a powerful Cloaking Device.

While the rest of the crew questions Twerk, who's unwilling to divulge too much about her other clients, they eventually get the victims narrowed down to Cthonians.

With their suspect off the ship, the crew of Silence are able to narrow down her identity; Maryl Street, a Cthonian defector adopted and brought under Twerk's wing. Being much alike, however, Virgo insists on talkingher down rather than capturing her by force, to which her team surprisingly agrees.

## The Chase
Tracking the suit down to an Aboleth nest, who's inhabitants were obviously out hunting, the party disembarks to try talking Maryl into coming back to the ship. Despite her onslaught of attacks, they continue doing until they begin hearing the calls of the Aboleths returning from their hunt.

Thinking fast, Barry increases the salt in the water, and uses the displacement from Maryl's AT Field to locate her and teleport the entire group back onto the Fix and Stitch. Still ready to fight, she reaches for a weapon port, but between Odysseus, Tweak, and Barry all pointing weapons at her, she backs down.
