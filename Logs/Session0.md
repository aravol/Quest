# Session 0, where it all begins
Session 0 consisted of creatings a new setting using [A Spark in Fate Core](http://www.genesisoflegend.com/PDF/A_Spark_In_Fate_Core-Setting_Creation_System.pdf). Note that the rules as written were not strictly adhered to, as noted below

## Media and Inpirations
Due to the interplay between media and the inspirations pulled therefrom, this is listed as a single step

| Media | Inspiration | Contributor |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Diablo, Monster Hunter World | [Monster Hunting](../Details/Monsters.md) | Scott |
| Borderlands | [Vault hunting](../Details/Vaults.md) | Jason |
| Evangelion | [AT Fields](../Details/ATFields.md) | David |
| Halo | [Spartan Suits](../Details/SpartanSuits.md) | Hailey |
| Octonauts | Underwater | Hilary |

## Genre and scale 
* **Genre Type**: Action-horror
* **Descriptor**: Subnautical
* **Scale**: Privateers

The game will focus more on action and less on the actual science of things, especially since psuedomagical effects are going to be big. Given the horrors of mutations, people eating monsters with impenetrable shielding, and the constant threat of drowning in the icy deeps, the game will be action-horror, like the Aliens movie; lots of bad things will happen, but most of it will culminate in something big and bad getting punched in the face.

## Facts
Note that this deviated off the beaten track of Spark, as the players had inertia for their setting at this point. The [Factions](../Factions.md) were also established here
* Melee weapons are necessary for hunting Monsters!
* Cthonian Civil war and lost tech
* With mutations come massive monsters
* Depth causes mutation
* Vaults might contain DNA samples
* Disaster destoryed the Native Capital
  * Ala la Pompeii
  * Natives in decline
* Volcanoes require daily sacrifices of gold or aliens
* Traveling at night has its consequences

## Sparks
This also deviated pretty far, since the Issues were pretty well known by now, and writing them into Sparks was more of a formality
* The Cthonian Civil War
* The Hunt for the [Vaults](../Details/Vaults.md)
* Declining Natives, rising Cthonians
* Terraforming

## Issues
These were largely self-writing after the facts step, and are again included primarily as a formality
* **Legacy**: The Cthonian Civil War
* **Current**: The Hunt for the Vaults
* **Impending**: Terraforming

## Faces
Note that some of these faces include entire [Factions](../Factions.md)
* **Legacy Supporter**: [Cthonians](../Faction/Cthonians.md)
  * **Description**: Wildly Mutated Theocracy
  * **Skill**: Mutations
* **Legacy Rejector**: [Natives](../Factions/Natives.md)
  * **Descriotion**: Wary of outsiders, looking for help
* **Current Supporter**: [Art Garfunckle](../Characters/ArtGarfunckle.md)
* **Current Rejector**: [Aliens](../Factions/Aliens.md)
  * **Description**: Bugs from Andromeda
  * **Skill**: Hive Mind
* **Impending Suporter**: [Zap Brannigan](../Characters/ZapBrannigan.md)
  * **Skills**: Shoot, Fight
* **Impending Rejector**: [Nigel Archibald Iceberry](../Characters/NigelIceberry.md)
  * *"Smashing!"*
  * **Description**: Ecoterrorist
  * **Skills**: Lore, Stealth

## Places
Rather than making places, an enitre map was created, with some locations put together as made sense for the setting rather than related to Sparks

## Characters
And then there were 4. Not wanting anyone stuck with the ship, the players agreed to an NPC to guide and pilot the [*Silence*](../Factions/Silence.md), [Kelvin](../Characters/Kelvin.md). See [Player Characters](../Characters/PlayerCharacters.md) for the list of who created whom.
