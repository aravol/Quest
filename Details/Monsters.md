# Monsters, exactly as the name implies
Monsters are creatures, usually large to massvive, capable of naturally emitting [AT Fields](../ATFields).

Some on Europa, particularly the [Cthonians](../../Factions/Cthonians), believe them to be divine and worship them as such. None, however, have ever noted any cooperation exhibited by monsters.
