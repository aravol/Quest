# The Weave, magic by any other name

The Weave is a poorly understood multidimensional effect which appears to alter reality according to the user's whim. Few have even begun researching technology capable of manipulating the weave, the most notable being [Barry McCockiner](../Characters/BarryMccockiner.md).

## AT Fields and the Weave

Among some, there are whipsers that the Weave may explain the more extreme abilities noted by [Monsters](Monsters.md), and some who have studied it largely believe that [AT fields](ATFields.md) are only the first, crude application the Weave may offer.
