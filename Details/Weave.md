# The Weave, magic by any other name
The Weave is a poorly understood multidimensional effect which appears to alter reality according to the user's whim. Few have even begun researching technology capable of manipulating the weave, the most notable being [Barry McCockiner](../../Characters/BarryMccockiner). Among some, there are whipsers that the Weave may explain the more extreme abilities noted by [Monsters](../Monsters), and some who have studied largely believe that [AT fields](../ATFields) are only the first, crude application the Weave may offer.
