# Sahuaguin, the Frog people of Europa

Approximately 5% of Sahuaguin are naturally born with four-arms, about the same rate at which [Humans] experience left-handedness. Due to their conflicts with the [Cthonians](../../Factions/Cthoniasn), however, most [Native](../../Factions/Native) aligned Sahuaguin look down on such individuals, even going as far as to have such mutations surgically "corrected."
