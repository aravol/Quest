# Sahuaguin, the Frog people of Europa

## Mutants

Approximately 5% of Sahuaguin are naturally born with four-arms, about the same rate at which [Humans](Humans.md) experience left-handedness. Due to their conflicts with the [Cthonians](../Factions/Chtonians.md), however, most [Native](../Factions/Native.md) aligned Sahuaguin look down on such individuals, even going as far as to have such mutations surgically "corrected."
