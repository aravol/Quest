# Tritons, masters of the deep

Tritons are the most [Human](Humans.md)-like of the species native to Europa, albeit ones who are natively semi-aquatic, with webbed hands and feet, along with other cutting fins adorning their bodies. Despite their ability to survive the water, they live happily in air-filled environments.
